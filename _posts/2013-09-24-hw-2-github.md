title: Homework 2 - github collaboration
---

For this assignment, I'm asking you work with a partner at the same time on different computers.

Choose a directory in the submissions repository in which to work. Probably one of the directories you worked in yesterday.

 * One of you add a file and commit it.
 * Both **git pull** to make sure you have the most up to date stuff
 * Both should edit commit and push the same file.
 * At sime point you should get a conflict.
 * git might say to git pull again before you push - if so, do that
 * Sometimes git will say you have to **git merge** the file. If so, do that.
 * Sometimes git will say it can't do an automatic merge and that you have to resolve things manualle. If so, edit the file and look for the change notations (they'll be aparent). manually change the file to look like what you want, then commit and push.

Play around with these as differnt situations will play out differently, but use th email list for help and hints and to suggest things as you think of them.

That's basically how to resolve things when multiple people are working on the same thing at the same time.
