# Minutia 01 
## Jae Ahn

* Classwork

We went over how to do minutia. We have to make sure to swap with someone if we know we're going to be absent that day
We also have to make sure to keep track on who is before us. 
Then, we went over Python and Flask. 

* Python
We went over substitution, where we can use  "%(letter)" to replace something
This would be wherever you wanted to put something in. I.E: 
name = "(name of choosing)"
num = (number of choosing)
template = "%s owes me %i dollars"
result = template%(name, num)
The unique thing about this is that we could effectively use the int function in the substitution. 

* Flask
String substitution can also be applied in flask. 
Flask uses jinja, which makes it useful to set up templates. 
Double brackets {{}} must be used for substitution. 

## All classcode can be found in the repsoitories in github. 

* Homework
We had to push and pull on git and work together in order to resolve conflicts on github.
