## Minutia 02
### Jane Argodale

###On Minutia
 * You get a zero for every day you don't do your assigned minutia! So do the minutia!
 * Email Mr. Zamansky if you're absent on your assigned day.

###Working at Home
 * When working from home, SSH into your school account so that you don't have to spend time doing git pull at school the next day.

###Jinja
 * With Jinja's templating system, you can insert if/else statements into HTML pages. Examples are up on class code.

###Python Lists
 *  list can be declared empty or with initializing elements, which can be of all kinds of different datatypes (ints, strings, other lists).
 * Can use indexing like a Java array, or use operations to append or take certain parts of a list.
 * Can be concatenated together with a plus sign, but remember that appending to a list edits the list, while setting a list to itself + some other list creates a new list out of those list parts.


###Python Dictionaries
 * Samples up on classcode
 * These are hash maps that can be indexed by any non-mutable datatype (strings, ints, etc).
 * Store key-value pairs, making for faster searchingâ€”expected constant time.
 * Tip for preserving this expected constant time: hash tables must be sparse to be effective.
 * Can retrieve all the values/keys.

###Homework
 * Just kidding, don't do it, because Mr. Z said we didn't get far enough with what he wanted to do in class today.
