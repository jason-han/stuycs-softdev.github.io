## Minutia 01
### Benjamin Attal

### Homework
 * Working together on pulling / pushing in git
 * Goal is to create a conflict and deal with it
 * Can be with someone from another class

### [Minutia](http://stuycs-softdev.github.io/minutia7.html)

 * If someone is going to be absent they must swap themselves on the list
 * Keep track of who is before you

### [Classcode] (https://github.com/stuycs-softdev/classcode)
 * **All the classcode will be in the classcode repository**

### Python Strings
String construction normal

    p1 = "Tom"
    p2 = "Sue"
    amt = 20
    result = p1 + " owes " + p2 + str(amt) + " dollars"
    print results

String substitution.  Must be in order

    template="%s owes %s the amount of %i dollars"
    result = template%(p1, p2, amt)

Spacing and different types

    amt = 2.5
    template="%s owes %10s %s the amount of %6.2f dollars"
    result = template%(p1, p2, amt)

Can use triple quoted strings to make everything look nice

### Templating in Flask
 * String substitution used in flask, very common for templates, along with triple quoted strings
 * Flask uses Jinja2
  * {{name}}
  * double brackets for var substitution
  * templates stored in "template" directory
 * render_template() function


    render_template('hello.html', name=name)
